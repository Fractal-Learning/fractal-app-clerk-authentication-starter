# Cursor rules have been migrated

This repository now uses Cursor's domain-scoped rules in:

- `.cursor/rules/00-core.mdc`
- `.cursor/rules/10-security.mdc`
- `.cursor/rules/20-architecture.mdc`
- `.cursor/rules/30-sql.mdc`
- `.cursor/rules/40-testing.mdc`

If you need to adjust guidance, edit the relevant `.mdc` file rather than re-adding rules here.
